## Installation
To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-A7med-i/ML-End-2-End.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  # On Windows use
  venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this project:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (see Installation section).

2. Run the Streamlit app:
```python
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501).


## Data
This project uses a loan status dataset, which includes various features about loan applicants and their loan status (approved/rejected). The dataset is sourced from [specify source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository].

Preprocessing steps include:
1. Handling missing values
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Feature scaling
4. Feature selection based on correlation analysis

## Model
We implement a Random Forest Classifier to predict loan approval status. Random Forest was chosen for its several advantages in this context:

1. High accuracy and good performance on imbalanced datasets
2. Ability to handle both numerical and categorical features without extensive preprocessing
3. Built-in feature importance ranking, which helps in understanding key factors in loan approval
4. Robustness against overfitting due to its ensemble nature
5. Capability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality

The Random Forest model is implemented using scikit-learn, allowing for easy integration with the rest of the machine learning pipeline.

## Training
The model is trained using cross-validation to ensure robustness.


## Evaluation
We evaluate the model using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## Deployment
The model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for loan status prediction.

To deploy:

1. Ensure the trained model is saved in the `model/` directory.

2. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

3. The app will be accessible via web browser, allowing users to input loan application details and receive predictions in real-time.
