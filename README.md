# End-to-End Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end machine learning projects, each demonstrating the full lifecycle of developing, evaluating, and deploying real-world ML models. Each project is self-contained with its own data, modeling pipeline, and deployment solution.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```zsh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd End-2-End
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project directory:**

   ```zsh
   cd "Data Science Salary"
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```zsh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```zsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   - See the project’s `README.md` for specific instructions (e.g., `streamlit run app.py` or `python app.py`).
