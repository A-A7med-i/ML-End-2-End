## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that cover the entire lifecycle from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. Each project includes detailed documentation and code to help you understand and replicate the process.

## Projects

### Project 1: Loan Status Prediction
- **Description**: Predict the approval status of loan applications using various machine learning models.
- **Deployment**: Deployed using Streamlit.
- **Technologies**: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Setup
To set up the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/A-A7med-i/ML-End-2-End.git
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Each project has its own directory with detailed instructions on how to run the code and deploy the models. Refer to the README file in each project directory for specific usage instructions.
